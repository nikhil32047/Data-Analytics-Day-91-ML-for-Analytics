 Machine Learning for Data Analytics

🔹 Lesson 1: Introduction to Machine Learning for Analytics
==============================================================
Summary:
Machine Learning (ML) enables predictive insights instead of just descriptive analytics.
Descriptive: What happened?
Diagnostic: Why did it happen?
Predictive: What will happen next?
Prescriptive: What should we do about it?

Example:
E-commerce companies use ML to predict which customers are most likely to repurchase within 30 days.

🔹 Lesson 2: Predictive Modeling Concepts
==============================================
Summary:
Predictive models use historical data to forecast future outcomes.
Split data into training and testing sets
Train models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests
Evaluate with metrics such as RMSE, R², or Accuracy

Example:
A retail company predicts monthly sales using past 12 months’ data (Regression).

🔹 Lesson 3: Regression Analysis (Linear & Multiple)
=======================================================
Summary:
Regression identifies the relationship between variables.
Linear regression: Predict continuous values
Multiple regression: Uses several predictors

Formula:

𝑦

Example:
Predicting house price based on size, location, and number of rooms.

🔹 Lesson 4: Classification Models for Business Decisions
============================================================
Summary:
Classification predicts categories, not numbers.
Common models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM.

Output examples: “Yes/No”, “Churn/Stay”, “Approved/Rejected”.

Example:
Bank predicts if a loan applicant is likely to default or repay using Logistic Regression.

🔹 Lesson 5: Case Study – Customer Churn Prediction
======================================================
Summary:
Steps:
--------
Collect customer and churn data
Clean and encode variables
Build and train a Logistic Regression model
Evaluate with accuracy and ROC-AUC metrics
Deploy insights to reduce churn

Example:
A telecom company predicts which users might leave and launches targeted retention campaigns, reducing churn by 20 %.
